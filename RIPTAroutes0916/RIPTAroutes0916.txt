  Description:
    Abstract: Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) statewide bus routes for public transit service with individual route information effective September 2016.
    Purpose: Transportation and transit system planning.
    Supplemental_Information: It is not the intention when using this data set to  determine the exact routing, timing or scheduling of bus trips. Transit system routes and schedules  including frequency of service change periodically.  Users of this data should check with RIPTA for the most up to data information and not rely on this data for final determinations. Please visit the RIPTA website for official bus stop and bus route information http://www.ripta.com.
